#Forecast Rental bond of New Zealand

**This repo includes all code for runing shiny App here: [https://luna.shinyapps.io/rents/](https://luna.shinyapps.io/rents/)**  
 
This data comes from MBIEâ€™s tenancy bond database, which records all new rental bonds that are lodged each month. The web link is [http://www.dbh.govt.nz/nz-housing-and-construction-quarterly-open-data](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/nz-housing-and-construction-quarterly-open-data). The data I downloaded is *Geometric mean rents by TA* which is processed with mean of each month from 1933 to 2014(I download at Mar 8, 2015). I forecasted the 2015 rental price based on this data.  

**Have Fun!**
